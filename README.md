Vrac is a frontend rendering library in Clojure, for Clojurists.

Features implemented so far:
- 100% Written in Clojure(script)
- Uses signals to do efficient fine-grained updates on the DOM
- As a good interop with React and Clojurescript React wrappers
- 100% compatible with Re-frame via the fork [Si-frame](https://github.com/metosin/si-frame)
- Has [concise and simple examples](/example) showing how to use it

Features on the roadmap:
- Declarative developer experience via a DSL
- Pluggable data management
- Transparent reactivity
- In browser dev tools
- Hot reloading
- Client-server data sync
